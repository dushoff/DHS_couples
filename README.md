Is there a broad-scale relationship between couple age difference and female HIV risk? Apparently, the current belief is maybe not, based on a study that failed to find one.

Should we explore this question using DHS data (and confidence intervals, so that we don't make an inappropriate conclusion of no effect)?

A big possible caveat is that there is a lot of lying about relationships in DHS data, but maybe it's worth trying across _stable_ relationships?

Please see [journal.md](journal.md) for the proposed analysis plan.
